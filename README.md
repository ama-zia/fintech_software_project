üí∏ Financial Health Digital Twin

A personal finance dashboard built with **Next.js + TypeScript + React**, designed to let users:

- Upload their transactions
- Forecast future balances
- Simulate ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenarios
- Visualize savings goals

Think of it as your **financial twin** that shows what could happen if you tweak your spending habits.

This project demonstrates **full-stack engineering**, modular React components, server-side computation, and interactive scenario simulation‚Äîall in a clean, type-safe codebase.

## üöÄ Features

### Upload CSV Transactions
- Drag & drop your CSV or select a file.
- Example CSV:
  ```csv
  date,amount,description,category
  2024-01-01,-4.5,Starbucks,Coffee
  2024-01-02,-30,Groceries,Groceries
  2024-01-05,2000,Salary,Income
Negative = spending, Positive = income. Transactions appear in a table where you can edit categories or delete rows.

### Transactions Table
Edit categories inline (e.g., coffee, groceries, rent).

Categories feed directly into the Scenario Builder.

### Forecast
Predict your future balance based on past spending.

Median prediction: The most likely outcome.

90% uncertainty band: Shows a range of possible outcomes using a Monte Carlo simulation.

Break-even line.

A simple, explainable trend + seasonality model is used for the forecast.

## Scenario Builder
Adjust category spending with sliders.

Simulate ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenarios: reduce coffee by 50%, increase rent, etc.

The forecast updates instantly to reflect the new scenario.

## Gamified Savings Goals
Predefined goals include:

Laptop ($2000)

Car down payment ($5000)

House down payment ($20,000)

Shows the months to reach goals based on projected savings.

If projected monthly savings are 0 or negative, it shows ‚Äú‚Äî‚Äù instead of fake numbers. ‚úÖ

Updates automatically when scenario sliders are changed.

## Currency Converter
Convert any amount between currencies using live FreeCurrencyAPI rates.

Simple interface:

100 USD ‚Üí GBP
Supports dozens of currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, CAD, AUD, JPY, INR, etc.).
